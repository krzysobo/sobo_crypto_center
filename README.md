# Sobo Crypto Center

The goal of this project is to create a set of Crypto tools that are easy to use for the average user and allow both encryption and decryption of any content offline, using both CLI and GUI, at the user's choice.

## TODO
- more encryption algorithms, including hybrid and asymmetric, allowing the use of key pairs
- more features for CLI
- GUI (DVUI? Caps? LVGL? Something else? Decision not made yet.)
- SQLite integration allowing storage of encrypted content
- ... many other things
